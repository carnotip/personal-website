					<h3>Seed Stage Funding</h3>
					<br>
					<p><img src="img/romulus_logo.png" style="padding-bottom: 70px;" width="200px"/>I have been involved with <a href="http://romuluscap.com/">Romulus Capital</a> since 2010. It is a seed stage venture capital firm which was founded by a good friend of mine, Krishna Gupta. I joined it when it had made two investments; now we are at 11 <a href="http://romuluscap.com/portfolio.html">investments</a>. As a part-time associate, I find investment opportunities at MIT and work with other associates to find opportunities in the New England area. I also work especially closely with <a href="http://www.zigfu.com">Zigfu</a> (YC S'11), a startup in the motion-controlled app space. In the process, I have enjoyed meeting a ton of smart VCs, entrepreneurs, and engineers. Most of all, I feel fortunate to be a part of the diverse, successful, and fun <a href="http://romuluscap.com/team.html">Romulus Team</a>; these are qualities I hope to emulate in teams I work with in the future.</p>

					<h3>Playing Card Games</h3>
					<br>
					<p>I grew up playing Bicycle playing cards. Whenever I visited India to meet the family, cards were a pretty common pass time. In high school, I got introduced and addicted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_'em">Texas Hold'em</a> (poker). A group of ~6 of us played poker every Friday evening for several hours straight. I started playing online but couldn't play with real money. So I got 1st place in two 5000+ person "freeroll" tournaments, which required no investment and paid the 1st place winner real money (it was the site's way of getting new paying users). I like to think my two wins were pure skill, but there was a LOT of luck involved. In summer 2011, I was living with three people (Facebook/Google interns at the time) and was introduced to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge">Bridge</a>. We reached a phase where all 4 of us came back from work every night and played Bridge for hours in a row till bedtime. I didn't get many chances to play Bridge after the summer, but it's something I want to get better at.</p>

					<h3>Playing Sports</h3>
					<br>
					<p>I started playing basketball in 3rd grade and really enjoy playing it to this day. My favorite team used to be the <a href="http://www.nba.com/pistons/index_main.html">Detroit Pistons</a> under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Brown_(basketball)">Larry Brown</a>; my interest in them faded when they traded much of their starting lineup and Larry Brown left. Before that, however, I loved watching the Pistons because they had no "star" player like LeBron James or Kobe Bryant. They had fantastic team players and unbeatable chemistry. It was fun to watch. <b>Another fun fact:</b> I have also volunteered as a K-5 basketball coach at my local YMCA for all four years in high school. Teaching kids basketball and the importance of teamwork has been one of the my most rewarding experiences. At MIT, I discovered squash and really enjoy the intensity and speed it demands. I am also taking advantage of my (relatively more) free time senior year to explore Ultimate Frisbee and Water Polo through my fraternity's intramural teams.</p>

				<div id="music" class="item">
					<h3>Being an Audiophile</h3>
					<br>
					<p>If I am working on my laptop, chances are I am also listening to Pandora with my Sennheiser HD headphones. Pandora is just amazing. I have discovered so much cool, unconventional, music through it. Generally, I enjoy rock (RHCP, Coldplay, Weezer), instrumental (EITS, Mute Math, Cinema 33, Album Leaf, Emancipator), and trance (AVB, Gareth Emery, Above & Beyond). I say "generally", because my musical tastes go through phases; my <a href="http://www.pandora.com/#!/profile/activity/dhruv.garg">upvotes</a> on Pandora span across many different genres.</p>

					<h3>Traveling</h3>
					<br>
					<p><img src="img/travel.jpg" width="200px"/>While I don't get to travel as much as I'd like (and I have passed up awesome travel opportunities to work on <a href="#projects">projects</a>), I have been fortunate to go a few cool places. Last year, I went with to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with my fraternity pledge class (see picture on left) for ~ week. By far one of the best vacations I've had in college. I have also traveled to Rome, Florence, Pisa, and Venice with my parents; Florence is one of the most beautiful cities in the world and I hope to re-visit it sometime with a nature-loving group. This year, I am planning to go to San Juan, Puerto Rico for a week with my pledge class over spring break. Really looking forward to that!</p>

					<h3>Evangelizing my Mom's Art</h3>
					<br>
					<p><img src="img/art.jpg" width="200px"/>My mom is very detail-oriented and is an artist. Though I got the detail-oriented genes from her, I definitely did not get the artistic talent part. She specializes in a special kind of art - Lippan Kaam or "Clay and Mirror Work". Lippan Kaam is a decorative art done by common people, mainly women, in the villages of Kutch, Gujarat. They make birds, trees, animals, peacocks, and human figures using a mixture of clay and camel dung. My mom makes it with a mixture of clays (thank god). The originality of this art lies in adding no color; instead, small, round, diamond shaped or triangle mirror pieces are used. I help her promote her work on the web using social media, because it turns out she's not very computer savvy (this is changing with her iPad). That said, check out her Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Anjus-Art/358381340868886">page</a> and <a href="#contact">let me know</a> if you are interested in placing an order!</p>

					<h3>Watching TV</h3>
					<br>
					<p>I really like "deep" and powerful shows that put emphasis on character development. I think it is because I have taken a few acting/theater classes while at MIT and the part I enjoyed most in those classes involved character analysis, figuring out why characters do what they do, etc... Some of my favorite shows are <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/index.html">The Sopranos</a>, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-wire/index.html">The Wire</a>, <a href="http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men">Mad Men</a>, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire/index.html">Boardwalk Empire</a>, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html">Game of Thrones</a>, and <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/californication/home.do">Californication</a>. Depending on my mood, I also really enjoy <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/modern-family">Modern Family</a> - one of the most genuine comedies out there.</p>

					<h3>Reading</h3>
					<br>
					<p>I don't get a chance to read books as much as I'd like, but I am trying to change this. I am currently reading a highly recommended book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1590597141">Founders at Work.</a> While I find it to be a little verbose at times, there are some great gems throughout the book which make the book worth it. In 2011, I discovered that Twitter is a phenomenal tool to keep up with what is going on in technology, startups, and the world at large. I read a lot through Twitter.</p>
